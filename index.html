<p style="width:900px">
In Splatoon 2, weapons are the only objective destinction between players apart from their gear and form the most important strategising and combat tool of the game. You purchase them at the weapons store "Ammo Knights"
which the owner Sheldon runs alone.
As you start at Level 1, more weapons get unlocked each level until you finally reach level 30, the <a href="#Clash" style="color:white">Clash Blaster</a> being the last,
 and the <a href="#Splattershot_Jr" style="color:white">Splattershot Jr.</a> being the first weapon to obtain.
 You use them by pressing <font size="+1">[ZR]</font> while aiming at a target. The fire rate, velocity, area of effect, damage, weight, bloom and shape of ink is determined by the weapon.
 However, not only are they good to eliminate your opponents, but they also paint the ground and walls granting you a higher level of mobility and thus limiting the latter for the opponent.

All of these properties are to keep in mind when choosing your weapon.
Each weapon has it's own strengths and weaknesses and each form a matchup giving an environment that can decide a battle.
Also deciding is the synergy of your weapon choice to that of your teammates. We call that a composition. 
This is the most important part when discussing strategy and meta (What gives me the best chance to win?).

	The Tentatek variant provides a more damage focused set while still 
	maintaining a good part of the initial movement capability.
	Its Inkjet-Splat bomb combination is crucial to take care of and most likely a kill once come too close.
	However, it's movement is more limited than the original version and requires a far more
	defensive playstyle and focus on surprise, making it a high risk-high reward weapon

	With a far more defensive special that requires disengaging the Kensa Splattershot is a highly strategic weapon

	<td>
	Lacking range and a good special, the Sploosh-o-matic is considered one of the less useful weapons the game can offer.
	It has a strong spread making it very hard for it to kill at maximum range. It does offer useful mobility for a short-ranged slayer, 
	but no mobility could bring it that close to the target for a kill. It solely relies on a lack of awareness of the opponent and heavy stealth
	which is one of the reasons players can contest it very easily.</td>

	Considered the most useless weapon in the game, the Neo Sploosh-o-matic lacks most essentials - 
	it lacks movement, range, an aggressive kit and has a lot of bullet spread. It's kit, though strong, doesn't compliment the main weapon at all 
	and puts it into a state where anyone who chooses this weapon is throwing by default.</td>

	As a niché pick that can space much better due to the splat bomb it requires a lot of swim speed to actually approach an enemy.

	Since it has an amazing painting set and main weapon,

	A technical baller-spam weapon that can also paint really well is perfect for obscure/cheesy comps and strategy.

	The Aerospray PG doesn't quite seem to have a role because it's a supportive, 
	high paint-low damage main weapon, highly aggressive burst bombs and a very defensive special weapon - Booyah bomb.
	Since it doesn't have a distinct playstyle, it doesn't fit any comps and is very bad in every role - you can only make it work in a very aggressive comp with the purpose to replace fallen teammates temporarily.</td>

	The Splattershot Jr. is probably the best support weapon in the game.
	It's high paint provide a lot of ground for your team and a fast special charge time.
	The armor it almost spams gives a huge advantage during team fights when defending or attacking.
	It has as the only weapon an enhanced ink tank giving it the opportunity to double-bomb (or quadruple bomb in combination with armor)

	The Kensa Splattershot Jr.'s kit is a rather aggressive alternative to it's other versions and therefore doesn't best suit the playstyle of the main weapon.

	The undercover brella has a very weak shield but can shoot while defending.
	It has very low damage output though, so it isn't the best excuse to use it.
	It has a too aggressive set and too low range to be used as anything other than slayer.</td>

	The kensa undercover brella is, contradictory to its previous versions, a really strong support weapon.
	Since the torpedo can damage very well, it can distract the enemy enough for the main weapon to kill by itself or damage so much that the low damage output is enough to kill.
	Especially when supporting slayers, it can kill super well and the armor is often fight deciding and very fast available when using this weapon.</td>
