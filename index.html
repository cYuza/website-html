<p style="width:900px">
In Splatoon 2, weapons are the only objective destinction between players apart from their gear and form the most important strategising and combat tool of the game. You purchase them at the weapons store "Ammo Knights"
which the owner Sheldon runs alone.
As you start at Level 1, more weapons get unlocked each level until you finally reach level 30, the <a href="#Clash" style="color:white">Clash Blaster</a> being the last,
 and the <a href="#Splattershot_Jr" style="color:white">Splattershot Jr.</a> being the first weapon to obtain.
 You use them by pressing <font size="+1">[ZR]</font> while aiming at a target. The fire rate, velocity, area of effect, damage, weight, bloom and shape of ink is determined by the weapon.
 However, not only are they good to eliminate your opponents, but they also paint the ground and walls granting you a higher level of mobility and thus limiting the latter for the opponent.</p>

All of these properties are to keep in mind when choosing your weapon.
Each weapon has it's own strengths and weaknesses and each form a matchup giving an environment that can decide a battle.
Also deciding is the synergy of your weapon choice to that of your teammates. We call that a composition. 
This is the most important part when discussing strategy and meta (What gives me the best chance to win?).

	<td>
	The Tentatek variant provides a more damage focused set while still 
	maintaining a good part of the initial movement capability.
	Its Inkjet-Splat bomb combination is crucial to take care of and most likely a kill once come too close.
	However, it's movement is more limited than the original version and requires a far more
	defensive playstyle and focus on surprise, making it a high risk-high reward weapon
	that values map awareness to a high level.</td>

	With a far more defensive special that requires disengaging the Kensa Splattershot is a highly strategic weapon
	to force enemies out of position through Tenta Missiles and Suction bombs. What it's predecessors has in strength,
	this version makes up for with teamcoordination and reliability.</td>

	<td>160</td>
	<td>
	Lacking range and a good special, the Sploosh-o-matic is considered one of the less useful weapons the game can offer.
	It has a strong spread making it very hard for it to kill at maximum range. It does offer useful mobility for a short-ranged slayer, 
	but no mobility could bring it that close to the target for a kill. It solely relies on a lack of awareness of the opponent and heavy stealth
	which is one of the reasons players can contest it very easily.</td>

	<td>
	Considered the most useless weapon in the game, the Neo Sploosh-o-matic lacks most essentials - 
	it lacks movement, range, an aggressive kit and has a lot of bullet spread. It's kit, though strong, doesn't compliment the main weapon at all 
	and puts it into a state where anyone who chooses this weapon is throwing by default.</td>

	As a niché pick that can space much better due to the splat bomb it requires a lot of swim speed to actually approach an enemy.
	However, it still lacks range a lot and needs to be played hyper aggressively and rarely fits into a comp due to it's lack of supportive capability and flexibility.</td>

	Since it has an amazing painting set and main weapon, 
	it's very useful in high-paint modes like splat zones or turf war, but is not able to kill by itself,

	A technical baller-spam weapon that can also paint really well is perfect for obscure/cheesy comps and strategy.

	<td>
	The Aerospray PG doesn't quite seem to have a role because it's a supportive, 
	high paint-low damage main weapon, highly aggressive burst bombs and a very defensive special weapon - Booyah bomb.
	Since it doesn't have a distinct playstyle, it doesn't fit any comps and is very bad in every role - you can only make it work in a very aggressive comp with the purpose to replace fallen teammates temporarily.</td>

	The Splattershot Jr. is probably the best support weapon in the game.
	It's high paint provide a lot of ground for your team and a fast special charge time.
	The armor it almost spams gives a huge advantage during team fights when defending or attacking.
	It has as the only weapon an enhanced ink tank giving it the opportunity to double-bomb (or quadruple bomb in combination with armor)

	Being overshadowed by it's vanilla version the Custom Splattershot Jr. is rarely being used.
	However, it definitely has it's place since it has a very strong paint and can paint alone,

	The Kensa Splattershot Jr.'s kit is a rather aggressive alternative to it's other versions and therefore doesn't best suit the playstyle of the main weapon.

	The splat brella is a strong supporting weapon that can protect its teammates in a small window of space and paint insanely much.
	The inkstorm helps paint </i>and</i> damage a lot. The main weapon also does a lot of damage and can slay during ink storms.</td>

	The sorella brella is much more aggressive but doesn't quite do the same job supporting.
	It can stall the autobombs or the bombrush to run into the opponent to open an opportunity to slay well.
	That takes a lot of time though and needs to be supported by other teammates and relies on the opponent being alone.</td>

	The tenta brella is a big shield that tanks a lot of damage and it can deny a lot of enemy attacks.
	The beakon is rather supportive and suits the weapon well, the bubbles are mainly used for defense with this weapon and therefore also help the weapon well especially for area defense, giving it an anchor property.</td>

	The camo tenta brella is a very defensive-aggressive weapon that focuses on shutting down space and denying anyone who tries to attack access.
	The ink mines help tracking enemies who try to attack from behind and damaging them and the stamp is good for chasing away opponents or possibly killing them.</td>

	The undercover brella has a very weak shield but can shoot while defending.
	It has very low damage output though, so it isn't the best excuse to use it.

	<td>
	The kensa undercover brella is, contradictory to its previous versions, a really strong support weapon.
	Since the torpedo can damage very well, it can distract the enemy enough for the main weapon to kill by itself or damage so much that the low damage output is enough to kill.
	Especially when supporting slayers, it can kill super well and the armor is often fight deciding and very fast available when using this weapon.</td>
