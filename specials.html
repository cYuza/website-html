<h1 align="center"><u>Special Weapons</u></h1>
<p style="margin-top:50px;width:800px;">
Special weapons are the strongest tools in the game and need to be charged over time to be able to be played.
You can only charge special weapons through painting the ground making it easier for weapons with high paint coverage to get them fast.
They are each unique and follow a certain goal. Usually it feels like they are very straight forward but often have a lot of different and unique ways to effectively utilise them.
</p>
<p style="width:800px;" align="justify">
There are a lot of different Abilities specifically made for special weapons, 
such as special charge up, special saver, special power up or tenacity, among others that only have some of those as side-effects such as comeback.
Special power up being discussed in the <a href="#table" style="color:white">table</a> below, I'm going to discuss (to some degree) special power up and special saver here.</p>
</font>
<p class="specialboxes" style="width:390px;float:left;" align="justify">
Special power up makes the special gauge fill much faster.
The state of the special in certain situations can determine fights or even whole games.
Depending on the special, it's important to use this! See below for the degree that special charge up affects the rate of the gauge filling by different amount of AP.</p>
<p class="specialboxes" style="width:390px;float:right;margin-right:150px;" align="justify">
If you die, you lose 50% of your charged special gauge.
Especially slayers, who die often, usually need to run special saver if their special is important to the gameflow.
As example, a custom blaster on Makomart TC should run special saver to be ready to push the enemy snipe with its inkjet once the tower reaches the first checkpoint.
See below for the degree that the special is saved in by different amount of AP and general special points.</p>

<tr>
	<td>Bomb Launcher</td>
	<td><a name="Bomb Launcher"><img src="weapon sprites\subs&specials\splatrush.png"></a></td>
	<td>You can throw bombs of the given type for a certain period of time (6 sec w/o spu)</td>
	<td>Increases duration</td>
	<td>see <a href="Sub.html#table" target="_blank">table of bombs</a></td>
	<td>The bomb rush is hard to define for all distinct types subsequently, but in general this special is not very strong.
	It's usually used to paint or to deny an area, or pop a tenta brella shield. However, there are many ways to destroy bomb launchers, as example can a booyah eat all bombs in its radius
	or an Ultra stamp destroys them manually. The strongest way to play bomb launchers is after those counters are being played by the opponents and to nullify their specials' efforts by painting
	over their turf and making those zones more dangerous now giving your teammates opportunities to push.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Inkjet</td>
	<td><a name="Inkjet"><img src="weapon sprites\subs&specials\inkjet.png"></a></td>
	<td>You enter a jet mode where you are able to fly and shoot exploding projectiles.</td>
	<td>The burst radius and uptime are enhanced</td>
	<td>30 (Min. Splash)
	50 (Splash)
	120 (Direct hit)
	30/sec (Exhaust)</td>
	<td>Tnkjet is one of the most aggressive and straight forward specials in this game.
	You usually want to get to high ground, kill with this or get to high ground and make it harder for the enemy to get forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Tenta Missiles</td>
	<td><a name="Tenta Missiles"><img src="weapon sprites\subs&specials\missiles.png"></a></td>
	<td>You let go missiles that track and directly attack enemies previously locked.</td>
	<td>Increases size of LOS and higher ink coverage missiles explosions</td>
	<td> 30 (Splash)
	150 (Direct hit) </td>
	<td>Being able to attack multiple enemies independently, the tenta missiles are a huge distractor for the whole map.
	You allow your teammates to push the opponents more easily. The only downside is that you usually don't get into positions where you can attack directly after firing.
	So you leave your team in a bad spot going 3v4, meaning that if you use your missiles, you want to do that when the enemy is one down, eg. if your backline gets an unforeseen pick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Ink Armor</td>
	<td><a name="Ink armor"><img src="weapon sprites\subs&specials\armor.png"></a></td>
	<td>Oncew activated, every team member is covered in an armor that disappears after a certain time or if hit.</td>
	<td>Increases uptime and decreases time between activating and armor application</td>
	<td>-</td>
	<td>The ink armor is the strongest support utility in the game overall, due to it being omnipresent on the map once used and in such a fast paced game like Splatoon,
	every frame saved is a huge advantage. Especially slow weapons like Blasters or Chargers or even bombs are greatly countered by armor and it should be used whenever there is any fight happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Splashdown</td>
	<td><a name="Splashdown"><img src="weapon sprites\subs&specials\splashdown.png"></a></td>
	<td>You go up high into the air and smash downwards, leaving a big explosion that deals high damage.</td>
	<td>Increases range</td>
	<td> 55 (Min. Splash)
	70 (Splash)
	180 (Direct hit) </td>
	<td>Being one of the most difficult special weapons, not mechanical wise but instead needing caution, the Splashdown is a high risk-high reward special.
	During the time that you are in the air, you freeze on the spot about 2m above the ground being vulnerable and people can pretty much kill you during this period of time.
	However, if they don't succeed, they most likely are going to die due to the big range the Splashdown offers.
	Through the recent patch it now also one-hits opponents above the explosion pretty easily making it a strong counter to Inkjets, for example.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Baller</td>
	<td><a name="Baller"><img src="weapon sprites\subs&specials\baller.png"></a></td>
	<td>You enter a ball that you can detonate on buttonpress or after a certain period of time. You are invulnerable while in the ball, but the ball itself can be shred.</td>
	<td>Inkreases durability and range</td>
	<td> 50 (contact)
	55 (splash)
	180 (direct hit) </td>
	<td>The baller is a more flexible special weapon that can either protect or attack.
	It should, however, only be used to either push or save your life, though often dying is more feasible than being saved alive.
	Its big and sudden paint can be used to lock off areas completely for a short time, making it useful in every game mode.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Sting Ray</td>
	<td><a name="Sting Ray"><img src="weapon sprites\subs&specials\ray.png"></a></td>
	<td>Changes main weapon temporarily which gives you wallhack and infinite range. You deal damage over time and in beam-shape.</td>
	<td>increases uptime and negates stealth abilities</td>
	<td> 108/sec(Direct hit)
	90/sec (Interference)</td>
	<td>Sting ray is the safest special to use and it's hard to use it wrong.
	You <i>can</i>, however, put yourself into an unfortunate and harder-to-deal-with situation.
	As example, you are left almost 100% vulnerable while using ray. Don't use it too close to enemies.
	According to simple math, your effective area also increases the further away you are!
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Ink Storm</td>
	<td><a name="Ink Storm"><img src="weapon sprites\subs&specials\cloud.png"></a></td>
	<td>Throwable rain that moves automatically in direction of throw after being deployed.
	Ink rains from above painting and damaging opponents.</td>
	<td>Increases duration and air throw range</td>
	<td>24/sec</td>
	<td>Ink Storms generally help with a huge variety of things but you can't specifically strategise those.
	You have all benefits at all times!
	Ink Storms always do paint and damage opponents, determining the direction of the fight and potentially blocking off certain parts of the map.
	They benefit the team that uses them freatly, giving them ground to push on and a stage to fight on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Bubble Blower</td>
	<td><a name="Bubble Blower"><img src="weapon sprites\subs&specials\bubbles.png"></a></td>
	<td>Your main weapon changes into a huge bubble blower that consists of ink and grows or shrinks in size when hit with ink or lethal bombs.
	You have no choice but to either let the weapon expire or use it three times. You can throw bombs while holding the weapon.</td>
	<td>Increases size and explosion radius</td>
	<td>30/sec (Contact)
	50 (Minimum Splash)
	250 (Direct hit) </td>
	<td>The bubble blower has two main aspects to always fulfill when using them:<br>
	Firstly kills, Bubble blower can kill very easily and destroy everything in their main range.<br>
	Secondly paint, the explosions of bubbles generally paint a lot and can potentially insta-cap a larger zone.
	Additional to this, it's always wise to use bubbles the more players are around you. Team mates help pop the bubbles and opponents are potentially endangered.
	Bubbles also have a defensive property, namely players can hide behind and inside them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Booyah Bomb</td>
	<td><a name="Booyah Bomb"><img src="weapon sprites\subs&specials\bb.png"></a></td>
	<td>You charge a bomb that detonates greatly by saying booyah (your teammates' booyahs count towards that)
	The detonation is rather slow.</td>
	<td>Faster charge, faster damage and higher throwing verlocity</td>
	<td>150/sec</td>
	<td>Booyah Bombs are a single AOE control utility that can shut down any space at once. Barely anything can push a tower during overtime once someone throws a booyah bomb at it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Ultra Stamp</td>
	<td><a name="Ultra Stamp"><img src="weapon sprites\subs&specials\stamp.png"></a></td>
	<td>The ultra stamp gives you a big hammer that you can either swing once per time through all obstacles,
	hold the button to rush towards an enemy stamping on the ground or throw the weapon using up all of its duration time.</td>
	<td>increases uptime</td>
	<td> 40 (stamp splash)
	100 (stamp direct hit)
	30 (throw min. splash)
	60 (throw splash)
	120 (throw direct hit) </td>
	<td>Having three different modes of direct usage, hammers are similarly strong.</td>
